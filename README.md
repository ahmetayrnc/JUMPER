# Jumper
Jumper an endless hyper casual experience
Try to jump to the next platform without falling until, forever...

###### How to play
In Jumper, the main goal is to score as much as possible. 
- Each time you jump to a platform you earn a point. 
- If you land on a collectiable shard, you gain more points. 
- If you fall the game ends.
- The game speeds up with the until a certain limit.

## Notes
- A simple 3d game made with Unity.
- The first game I have ever built.
- Source code included.

## Platform Notes
- This game is compatible with Iphone. However, due to me having no experience with macbooks and not having one, there is no build for iphones yet.
- The controls for phones are with touch input and it is made such that the ball would follow the pressed finger. However, in Unity Editor controls are swithched to W,A,S,D keys to test the game.
- For testing purposes, the current build setting for the game is on android.
